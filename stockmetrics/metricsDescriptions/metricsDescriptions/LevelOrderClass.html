        This metric reports the level order of a class. The level order is defined as 0
        for classes which are dependent on no other project classes. Classes with
        dependencies have level order equal to one more then the greatest level order
        of their dependency classes, ignoring classes on which they have mutual or cyclic dependencies.
        Conceptually, level order measure how many "layers" of software a class or interface depends on.
        Classes with large level orders may be difficult to test and maintain.
        In designs with large cyclic dependencies, level order may give an unreasonably
        rosy picture of how many layers of software depends on.
