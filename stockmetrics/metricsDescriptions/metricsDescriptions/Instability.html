        Calculates the Instability of a package. The Instability of a package is defined
        as the package's Efferent Couplings divided by the sum of the package's Afferent and Efferent
        Couplings <code>(Ce√∑(Ca+Ce))</code>.
        This metric has a range of [0,1]. I=0 indicates a maximally stable package, I=1 indicates a maximally
        unstable package.
        <p><p>
