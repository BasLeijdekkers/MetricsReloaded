        Calculates the instability of a <b>package</b>. The instability of a <b>package</b> is defined
        as the package's efferent couplings divided by the sum of the <b>package</b>'s afferent and efferent
        couplings (Ce√∑(Ca+Ce)).
        This metric has a range of [0,1], 0 indicates a maximally stable category, 1 indicates a maximally
        unstable category. For more information on the instability metric and how it is used, see
        <a>http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/oodmetrc.pdf</a>.
