        Calculates the Abstractness for each package.
        Abstractness is defined as the number of abstract classes and interfaces divided by
        the total number of classes of the package.
        This metric has a range of [0,1]. A=0 indicates a completely concrete package,
        A=1 indicates a completely abstract package.
