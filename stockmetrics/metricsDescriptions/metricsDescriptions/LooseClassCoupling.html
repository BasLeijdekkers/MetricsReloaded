        Calculates the ratio of connected or indirectly connected method pairs to all method pairs in a class.
        Two methods are connected if they use at least one common attribute (an attribute can be from another class).
        Two methods <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> are indirectly connected if there is a method sequence <b>M_1, ..., M_n</b>
        such that <b>A = M_1</b>, <b>B = M_n</b> and <b>M_i</b> connected with <b>M_i+1</b>
        for all <b>i</b> in <b>[1..n-1]</b>.
