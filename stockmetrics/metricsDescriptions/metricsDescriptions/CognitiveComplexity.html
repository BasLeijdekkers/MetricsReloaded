        Calculates the Cognitive Complexity of each non-<b>abstract</b> method.
        The metric is similar to Cyclomatic Complexity,
        but is intended to explicitly measure understandability, which can be quite different from testability.
        Cognitive Complexity is increased with each control structure used and is higher the more nested
        control structures are.
