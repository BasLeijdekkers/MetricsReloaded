        Calculates the number of efferent couplings for each package. An efferent
        coupling is a reference from a <b>class</b> or <b>interface</b> internal to the package to a
         <b>class</b> or <b>interface</b> external to the package. Test classes and library classes are
        not included.
        For more information on the efferent coupling metric and how it is used, see
