        Calculates the cyclomatic complexity of each non-<b>abstract</b> method. Cyclomatic complexity
        is a measure of the number of distinct execution paths through each method.
        This can also be considered as the minimal number of tests necessary to completely exercise a method's control flow.
        In practice, this is 1 + the number of <b>if</b>'s, <b>while</b>'s, <b>for</b>'s, <b>do</b>'s, <b>switch</b>
        cases, <b>catch</b>es, conditional expressions, <b>&&</b>'s and <b>||</b>'s in the method.
