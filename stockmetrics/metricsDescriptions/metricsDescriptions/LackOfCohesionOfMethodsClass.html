        Calculates on the degree of cohesiveness of a class.
        We use a variant of the LCOM metric designed by Hitz and Montazeri,
        which is more appropriate for Java. The metric says that two methods
        of a class are related if they share a variable use, or one method calls
        another. The metric is then the count of the number of components of the
        method relation graph.
        A value of 1 indicates a highly cohesive class, which can not
        easily be split into smaller classes. Higher values may indicate
        that the class may be "doing too much", and should be split. Note
        that constructors, equals(), hashCode(), toString(), clone(), finalize(), readObject(), and writeObject()
        methods are not considered, as these scaffolding
        methods often touch all variables in a class, and would thus result in metrics
        values indicating more cohesiveness than is actually apparent in the design.
